## About The Project

The Vermilion Bank is an online banking website with a proper backend and database. The objective of the project was to learn to use node and express to create a backend, use middlewares and authenticate users via JWT.

## Project Duration

12 days with some fixes post-completion (see [commits](https://github.com/marcialcarrillo/konrad-p3-frontend/commits/main) made after July 8).

## Usage Notes

- You can log in as a guest.
- If registering a new account, the email doesn't have to be valid, it just needs an appropriate format. Images must be 1MB or less for the profile and ID.
